Many a stackoverflow page will suggest tweaking your Build Settings, but it can be hard to remember how to get to those settings. Here's how:

**Go to the directory view of the navigation sidebar and click on the project folder icon.**

*NOTE:* There are separate build settings for the Project and its Targets- be sure to check out both!
