## FAQ

### Nerdy articles
- Should I go [native or hybrid?](https://hackernoon.com/react-native-vs-real-native-apps-which-is-better-a8383d6f7ca5)
    - https://stackshare.io/stackups/java-vs-swift-vs-python
- How does [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)#Comparisons_to_other_languages) compare to other languages?
    - Swift highlights:
   	- It has a clean and modern syntax
	- offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code and frameworks
	- is memory safe by default
- How popular is Swift?
    - It is fairly high on the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), updated monthly.
- [How object oriented is Swift?](https://skookum.com/blog/swift-blurs-the-lines-of-programming-paradigms)
	- you can subclass classes, and you can override functions in subclasses, but enums and structs are not really OO
- Do I need to purchase an Apple developer account?
    - You do not need a developer account to develop in Xcode and use the device simulator.
    - A Developer account lets you run your app on a real device and publish to the app store.
- Why did you include style? Is style checking really that important?
    - Fun fact, consistent indentation style is one of the most statistically significant indicators of [low bug density](https://books.google.com/books?id=hjEFCAAAQBAJ&pg=PR22&lpg=PR22&dq=Consistent+indentation+style+is+one+of+the+most+statistically+significant+indicators+of+low+bug+density.&source=bl&ots=T7eLrGZFOo&sig=2WnH3QqMLJntoIyfPnQC2jg86no&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjb6O-d84PdAhVQX60KHUzTAOwQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=Consistent%20indentation%20style%20is%20one%20of%20the%20most%20statistically%20significant%20indicators%20of%20low%20bug%20density.&f=false)
    - Swiftlint [helps enforce best practices.](https://theswiftpost.co/using-swiftlint-and-danger-for-swift-best-practices/)

### Really useful links
- Can I please just download an example project and start there?
	- In addition to the Storyboard tutorial and file manipulation example above, here is a nice variety of [30 Example Projects](https://github.com/soapyigu/Swift-30-Projects)
- How is the documentation?
    - Pretty darn thorough:
        - Swift documentation: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html
